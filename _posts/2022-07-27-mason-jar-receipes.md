## TL;DR

- **Dressing / Ingredients / Greens** - This order from stuff you want to be marinating in the dressing ---> stuff that needs to be kept out of the dressing until serving.
- **Don't pack the ingredients in tightly**- It's way too much food if you fill it up and its impossible to get out. Ingredients seem to get to know each other better if the jar is less tightly packed
- **You need a 1 litre jar** - generous one-person meal size if loosely packed.
- **Mayo-based dressings don't really work** - unless you make the dressing really thin.
