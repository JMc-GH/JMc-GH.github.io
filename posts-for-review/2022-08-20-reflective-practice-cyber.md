In paramedicine we rely on reflective practice. I think this is because medicine is a field that is advancing quickly - faster than you could keep up with through structured learning, text-books, class-based, e-learning, etc. The idea is that you analyse what you did with a view to doing it better next time - this kind of gives you a specific area to research and understand better. The goal is to improve your practice. [Christopher Johns](https://www.toolshero.com/personal-development/johns-model-of-reflection/) identified reflection as a means of professional supervision, a structured way of letting us step back and look at what just happened. As ambulance people the opportunities are scarce to discuss jobs with colleagues, so this offers a way of discussing it with yourself, sort of.

I want to start applying reflection the next stage of learning, and subsequently to my practice as an info-sec professional. I think it'll work; as a pentester you work with discreet 'incidents' where you might try something different to gain access, and record whether it worked or didn't under those circumstances, for example. Or serve as a marker to learn more about a specific system, vulnerability, exploit, etc. I'll come back to how to fit reflective practice into my new profession, for the time being I want to find a way of applying it to the postgraduate course I'm starting soon.  

So first look around at structures for reflective practice whilst learning; previously at [Sheffield Hallam](https://www.shu.ac.uk/courses/paramedic-science/bsc-honours-paramedic-science/full-time/2022) and [Huddersfield](https://courses.hud.ac.uk/2022-23/part-time/undergraduate/paramedic-practice-top-up-distance-learning-bsc-hons) I've used the [Brightspace](https://www.d2l.com/brightspace/) learning platform which comes with an [ePortfolio](https://staffresources.uhi.ac.uk/support_portal/resources/bs_eportfolio/) - this lets you group reflections, comments and assessments into collections - and then you can add meta-data to those collections. No templates are provided for reflection. It's OK but more of a repository than a template for structured reflection, also there seems to be a configuration problem with the permissions on the meta-tags at least for the implementation at Huddersfield University. I might come back to this :-).

I've always used [Gibbs](https://books.google.co.uk/books/about/Learning_by_Doing.html?id=xVv4SAAACAAJ&source=kp_book_description&redir_esc=y) reflective 'cycle'. It seems to be the trend that things are 'cycles' implying some kind of never-ending learning process. I might be doing it wrong by I like to finish a reflection - although some actions will spring from it. But this is what Gibbs looks like:

I'm also not totally clear on what might trigger a reflection - maybe attending an online lecture, reading a paper, writing some code, dunno. It might be temping in that case to write a review of what ever I've just done rather than deriving further learning from it.

### To Do

- What do other Infosec practitioners do?
- Have a look at whatever York University's learning platform does
- Explore other models of reflection
