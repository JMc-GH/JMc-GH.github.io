I lived in Llandudno from age 3, when my parents loved from Scotland. We stayed until I was 15, so I pretty much grew up in the town.

I've visited maybe 4 times in 30 years, never really had any love for it. I think because I thought I didn't have when I lived here, but in my defense I was a teenager, no teenagers like where they grew up. "It's shit"? This feeling carried over for the past 3 decades. This time of visiting I feel the connection to the town more. I had a quick walk round on my own.

The local landmarks; Bog Island, Billy Lals bargain centre, the door to the flat where my mate used to live with his mum (convenient for skiving off PE), the businesses that are still there: The Male Box. It seemed that we were all quite heavily focused in 1988 about where we were getting our flat-tops done (with one of the big comb things with a spirit level in it). The Carlton being still there sparked a few synapses. There was Billy Mac's corner that used be en-route to Tri-Bells - the chip shop that was on trend for a while (according to Facebook comments - still is now).

On the whole I think the last 30 years had been kind to the town. I think its still pretty much the same when wandering around at night - late middle-aged couples strolling through town, the odd group of 18-20 year olds passing the time, the odd max-powered Corsa buzzing carrying 8-10 of the what would normally be pavement-based teenagers. Swing music emanating from the just-about-maintained-to-an-acceptable-level coach-trip receiving hotels, bingo at the Carlton (I seem to remember this place being rough - my mate lived there - they had relocated from Manchester - Longsight I think and his Dad, the landlord - I don't think took any prisoners. I can't remember what the Victoria arcade used to be; I think a row of shops with a TSB.

The accent is back too a bit too - although I do mirror local accents quite easily (not sure what this says about me). I’ve always had it; people assume its some kind of scouse and I usually only correct them to ‘Cheshire’ and actually my accent is a mix of Scottish, Northwich and North Wales. It’s actually mainly North Wales, and you can tell when I’m here. And so is the Welsh language – I hated learning this at school, waste of time, I’m not Welsh, etc. I realise now I should have been more respectful – and maybe paid more attentions. It surprises me how much went in and that I now retain – if I’d actually bothered to put some effort in, instead of complaining about, learning Welsh I’d probably have a second language now. Does Welsh count as a second language? Fuck yes. When I was here I just assumed that the language would die – it hasn’t – I think its got stronger; the next generation are speaking welsh.

I never appreciated being between the sea and mountains. I walked my route from school into town this evening. This is the route that me and my mate would take for our hour lunch break. The menu for our (I think) our £1 lunch money was: 10 fags – 80p, 1 jam doughnut (from the Bakers Oven) – 20p. Chips if I didn’t have to buy fags. We’d usually go to Winnie’s cafe which I think was underneath the Neville (pub/hotel). This was a sandwich shop/cafe where we could turn up a lunchtime, in school uniform, be served a plate of chips and gravy with the heel of the bread (presumably left over from sandwich production) – served by an elderly lady (Winnie). The great thing about this place was it was literally underground, so could relax, talk-shit and smoke whilst wearing school uniform without fear of being spotted and grassed up to our head of year. I think the way in was here:

Also never noticed the mountains to my right; ever. This wasn’t on my radar. According to Wikipedia one of Llandudno’s ‘Cultural Connections’ is that Brookside character Petra Taylor committed suicide here in 1984. The greatest orator of his time and Llandudno-phile John Bright, was presumably further down the list. My high school (now ASDA) was named after him. He's thought to be the first to coin the phrase "flogging a dead horse", make your own jokes about that in relation to my education.

Some things have remained the same, the locals and the seagulls are still battling for overall control of the town, although there are now more regular incursions by the goats. What the fuck have you been feeding these seagulls for the past 30 years? There were never this big, or intimidating. If this continues the birds will shortly have the upper-hand.

It’s really friendly. It’s sunny. It’s clean. Its a bit weird. Feels like it’s on an upward trajectory - or maybe It's me on a downward one. I expect Llandudno does get more appealing as you get older. Here's the famous Tribells today:
