## Object Oriented
Multiple objects can be created from the same class, enabling the re-use of the same flexible code through inheritance. 
Protection of data and functions through encapsulation improves maintainability. Functions and data of an object may be easier to visualise as they can be modelled on the real-world object that they represent.
Concepts such encapsulation, polymorphism and inheritance can be difficult to undersand - maybe a steep learning curve (as we may all find out!) Also, more code is required to implement OO meaning more instructions to execute leading to potentially slower run times.

## Structured
Code can be easier to understand as programs have a more logical flow, so may be easier to debug. This also enables a quicker and cheaper development process.
Can be more straightforward but may not suited to complex models. Although code can be reused through function calls it lacks the extensibility of objects. Does not provide same extent of separation of data and functions as with Object Oriented.
