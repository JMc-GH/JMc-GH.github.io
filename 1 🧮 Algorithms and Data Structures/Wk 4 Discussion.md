In the worst case it would take 66 million iterations to find a specific person using a linear search. This doesn't sound very efficient to me. There must be a better way :-) 

The main advtange of strucutred English is that it in English - so can be understood easily by English-speaking humans! But this is also it's disadvantage because it requires translation into machine executable code before it can be used.

Programming code is executable , but takes specialist knowledge to produce and can be difficult for those not familiar with the specific language used to understand. I sometimes find it difficult to 'think in code' so designing in strucutred English or pseudocode first makes code implementation easier becuase I can separate design-thinking from implementation-thinking (if that makes any sense).

Pseudocode is a balance of the two, it shares syntax and structure with programming code. It is easier to translate into programming code than strucutred English. I have found formats and conventions to vary for pseudocode. Anyone who like me borrowed an out-of-date dead-tree edition of "Introduction To Algorithms" and relied on it's pseudocode conventions for this course will know what I mean!
