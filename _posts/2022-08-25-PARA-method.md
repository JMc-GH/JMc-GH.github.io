I've settled on Obsidian for note making, because:

- It's markdown (everyone loves markdown?), so no propriatory format.
- Can be checked into github
- Graph view - a potentially useful 'Second Brain' tool.
- Community plug-ins - lots of useful tools and customisations to revisit later.
- Good online community

Then there is how to organise notes within Obsidian, I've had a look at the PARA method (definitions from [fortelabs.co](https://fortelabs.co/blog/para/)):

- **Projects** A series of tasks linked to a goal, with a deadline
- **Areas** of responsibility. A sphere of activity to be maintained over time. So home finances, travel, health, car, etc
- **Resources** A topic or theme of ongoing interest
- **Archive** Inactive items from the above.

Following this I though that _Resources_ could do with a bit more definition. So examples of categories that might live in here:

- Java
- Pentesting
- Note-taking

I've also added an **Inbox** top-level folder.

Next think to do its make some note [templates](https://benenewton.medium.com/my-obsidian-daily-note-template-a4bdab53dc62) and maybe start a [zettlekasten](https://beingpax.medium.com/zettelkasten-method-with-obsidian-how-to-take-smart-notes-with-examples-cdaf348febbd).
