Part of upcoming masters degree involves using [Java](https:///www.java.com), which I have no experience with. I also never had any intention of learning it before now, I would have preferred to have added something like [Go](https://go.dev) - but this is only because I see it used frequently in pen-test and bug bounty tools. Advantages are that I could potentially start bug-hunting mobile phone apps thanks to Java's portability across device types. Also I think [BurpSuite](https://www.portswigger.net) is written in Java and it's one of my aims to write my own modules for this (although I don't think this has to be done in Java).

I learned Javascript using [Codecademy](https://wwww.codecademy.com), so I'm comfortable with it. As well as the code tutorials it also provides curated and useful online resources - which can save a lot of time. The course materials also reference a book for pre-reading [Java in 2 Semesters](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Java-Two-Semesters-Featuring-Computer/dp/3319994190), which I'll work through after the basic Codecademy course.

I'm putting my practice code in this [Git Repository](https://github.com/JMc-GH/CPD) - this really just to make it portable, so I can work on it wherever I am and on whatever machine.
