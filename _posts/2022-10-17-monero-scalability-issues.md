Most cryptocurrency transactions are not private, in fact they are the opposite. Use any of the major crypto currencies your transactions are logged on the public blockchain, forever - and are subject to increasingly stringent scrutiny from the authorities. The antithesis of this is Monero - one of a few 'Privacy' coins. I've been using it for a few years now, as a miner and as a means of payment. Unlike most other crypto currencies (including Bitcoin), transactions are secret. Why would you want that? I suppose the same reason that you have blinds on your windows, you're not up to anything nefarious - but that doesn't mean you want to be on display to the world.  

I think it might come as a surprise to the layperson that you can have a look at anyone's Bitcoin wallet, as long as you know their wallet address. This [wallet](https://bitinfocharts.com/bitcoin/address/34xp4vRoCGJym3xR7yCVPFHoCNxv4Twseo) has nearly $4bn worth of Bitcoin in it. But I don't know who owns it - if I was in a position of authority, perhaps flowing from a nation state, I could find out. The danger point from a privacy point of view is when you exchange from fiat currency, which is usually done through a centralised exchange such as Binance or Coinbase. These exchanges are already fairly heavily regulated and are required to be KYC compliant. So they have your Bitcoin wallet address, and a copy of your driving licence (or whatever) and access to all of your transaction history for that wallet. The wallet containing those billions of dollars worth of bitcoin is a Binance wallet, so will be subject to regulation.  

The other privacy stumbling block for Bitcoin (and now Ethereum) is censorship. Try cashing out any of the Bitcoins that were stolen in the [Mt Gox heist](https://blockonomi.com/mt-gox-hack/) on Coinbase - you'll find them marked as 'dirty'. There are ways around these privacy hurdles, for example you could exchange your crypto on a decentralised exchange or even in-person with something like [localbitcoins](https://localbitcoins.net/). Obviously the problem here is that your could receive dirty Bitcoin, and so be limited in what you can spend it on. Also, do you really want to be sending cash in the post to an unknown individual on the promise of receiving some crypto? Or getting involved with in-person exchanges or maybe dead-drops. It doesn't seem like the brave new cryptocurrency world that we are all hoping for.  

Ethereum, the second biggest cryptocurrency (with a market capitalisation comparable to the New Zealand Dollar) is also now subject to censorship. The [news recently emerged](https://thecryptobasic.com/2022/10/15/ethereum-centralization-concerns-resurface-as-51-of-blocks-produced-are-ofac-compliant-hoskinson-responds/) that more than 51% of transactions processed in Ethereum's new consensus model are subject to US Treasury intervention. In reality this means that all Ether transactions are likely subjected to government scrutiny. This is obviously sold as a good thing, providing protection from fraud - in reality it means the government can monitor how you make and spend money.

Its a bit of stretch to say that Bitcoin and Ethereum have failed because of this. Having said that I don't think they can be called fungible any more (i.e. one bitcoin is the same as any other) or private - which is contrary to Satoshi's original [vision](https://whitepaper.io/document/0/bitcoin-whitepaper) for Bitcoin. The mystical founder of Bitcoin expected users to keep their public keys secret, difficult in the current context of regulation - and also impractical for use as a currency (you need to give other parties you wallet address so they can pay/be paid by you. It's clear that at least some of the motivation to create bitcoin was the ability to operate outside of the international banking system.

Perhaps the Monero project's own statement on privacy sums up it's value, in a fairly stark way:  

> Monero takes privacy seriously. Monero needs to be able to protect users in a court of law and, in extreme cases, from the death penalty. This level of privacy must be completely accessible to all users, whether they are technologically competent or have no idea how Monero works. A user needs to confidently trust Monero in a way that this person does not feel pressured into changing their spending habits for risk of others finding out.

Okay, so the elephant in the room, the privacy features of Monero is appealing to criminals. Regulating Monero may aid law enforcement authorities in stemming the flow of ill-gotton gains. I think it would be perhaps more reasonable to attempt to stop the crime rather than one of the tools used in its commission. It seems like a sledgehammer to crack a nut, comparable to regulating or banning cameras to stop the proliferation of pornography. There are of course legitimate uses for monero. Commercial organisations may want to benefit from the speed of transactions provided by crypto, but may not want their competitors to see who their suppliers or customers are. Monero has been used for anonymous donations, such as [Wikileaks fundraiser for Edward Snoden's defence](https://www.theverge.com/2013/10/28/5039196/wikileaks-launches-site-for-edward-snowdens-legal-defense-free-snowden). Projects such as [Bail Bloc](https://thenewinquiry.com/bail-bloc/). There is an anarchic undercurrent to a lot of Monero use-cases, but is there really a downside to keeping your finances secret?

It doesn't *have* to be private. If you give some monero to your child and want to see what their spending it on, use can use their 'View Key' to look at transactions in a wallet (there is a separate 'Spend Key' which you *will* want to keep private). This applies equally to an organisation that is required to be financially transparent, 'View Keys' can be published or supplied to a regulator. 

Monero and other privacy coins will face challenges, not just because of increasing scrutiny from authorities. There are some questions over the scalability of Monero's distributed blockchain, and wether it will support the 1000+ tps that a secure future would require. It makes centralised exchanges nervous, due to it's use by criminals. Market liquidity has been a problem recently, with some exchanges suspending withdrawls occaionally. Authorities would love to crack Monero, and this would spell the end for this coin. The IRS are serious about this with a [$625,000 bounty](https://www.bitdefender.co.uk/blog/hotforsecurity/can-you-crack-monero-irs-offers-625000-bounty-for-anyone-who-can-break-privacy-of-cryptocurrency) up for grabs (the fact that this is still on offer probably inndicates that Monero is still secure).

They key and overriding point of privacy is that you don't know you need it until it's too late. You don't lose anything by keeping your spending habits to yourself - but potentially a lot to gain, especially if your current regime is become more and more authoritarian.
